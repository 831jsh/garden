# Using Garden

## [Features and usage](./features-and-usage.md)

In this article we discuss how to start a new project with `garden create`, the basic development workflow, how Garden's providers work, and the basics of testing and dependencies.

## [Configuration files](./configuration-files.md)

This one is all about Garden's configuration files. The difference between project and module configs, some significant specific fields, setting up services, and a primer on tests.

## [Remote Clusters](./remote-clusters.md)

Most of the time we want to develop locally, with our project running in Minikube or Docker. If you'd like to use a remote cluster though, check out this guide.

## [Hot Reload](./hot-reload.md)

This article discusses how to use hot reload, so that you can update files on the fly, without losing state and without having to destroy and re-create your container.
