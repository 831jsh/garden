# Example projects

## [Hello world](hello-world.md)

In this project we see in practice the basics of configuring dependencies, defining ports and endpoints, and setting up tests.

## [Simple project](simple-project.md)

Here we see how to "gardenify" a pre-existing project, creating a project config and the individual module configs for every part.

## [TLS project](tls-project.md)

This is an example project of how to set up TLS using the `mkcert` tool.

## [Remote sources project](remote-sources.md)

This project demonstrates how to use multiple sources and repositories together into the same project. Although in this project we're using _remote_ sources, the same applies to using multiple _local_ repositories.
