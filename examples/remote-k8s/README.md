# Remote Kubernetes example project

This project shows how you can configure Garden to work against a remote Kubernetes cluster, in addition to a local
cluster.

The example follows the [Remote Kubernetes guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/remote-kubernetes.md). Please look
at the guide for more details on how to configure your own project.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to have a running Kubernetes cluster, that you have API access to, and that has an exposed _nginx_ ingress
controller. If you haven't already, you'll need to configure a `kubectl` context that has access to your cluster.
Please refer to your cluster provider for how to do that.

If you don't already have one, you also need to configure a private container registry. You could for example use
[quay.io](https://quay.io), create a private registry on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.io), or use the registry
provided by your cloud provider.

### Step 1 - Update the context and cluster hostname in your config

You need to update the `remote` environment configuration in your project `garden.yml`.
Replace `my-context` with your configured `kubectl` context for the remote cluster, and `mycluster.example.com`
with a hostname that points to the ingress controller on your cluster.

### Step 2 - Get a certificate for your cluster hostname

How you do this will depend on how you generally manage DNS. Basically, you need a valid TLS certificate and key for
the hostname you configured above. If you don't have a prior preference on how to create certificates, we suggest using
Let's Encrypt's [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) and using the `certonly` option to generate certs.

### Step 3 - Configure the certificate in your Kubernetes installation

Create a Kubernetes Secret with your generated certificate and key (replace the filenames appropriately).

```sh
kubectl create secret tls garden-example-tls --key my.key --cert my.crt
```

### Step 4 - Configure a remote container registry

Each different container registry will provide different instructions on how to configure Kubernetes to authenticate.
You can also use [Heptio's guides](http://docs.heptio.com/content/private-registries.html) for configuring private
registries.

You'll also need to login to the `docker` CLI, so that images can be pushed to the registry. Please refer
to your registry's documentation on how to do that (for Docker Hub you simply run `docker login`).

_Note that if you're using GKE along with GCR, and your deployment registry is in the same region and on the same
account as the GKE cluster, you can remove the `imagePullSecrets` section from the `garden.yml` and skip creating
the auth secret._

When storing the registry authorization via `kubectl create secret docker-registry`, use the name
`garden-example-registry-auth` for the secret, and place it in the `default` namespace (or update the `garden.yml`
configuration with the name and namespace you chose).

## Usage

Once you've completed the above, you can run deploy the project to the `remote` environment, by setting the
`--env` flag when running `garden` (or you can change the `defaultEnvironment` entry in your `garden.yml`):

```sh
garden --env remote deploy
```

And then try sending a simple request using:

```sh
garden --env remote call node-service/hello
```
