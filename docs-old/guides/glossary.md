# Glossary

#### Environment
Represents the current configuration and status of any running services in the [project](#project), which may be 
inspected and modified via the Garden CLI's `environment` command.

Several named environment configurations may be defined (e.g. _dev_, _testing_, ...) in the [project's 
`garden.yml`](../guides/configuration.md#project-configuration).

#### Module
The basic unit of configuration in Garden. A module is defined by its
[`garden.yml` configuration file](../guides/configuration.md#module-configuration), located in the module's top-level 
directory, 
which 
is a subdirectory of the [project](#project) repository's top-level directory.

Each module has a [plugin](#plugin) type, and may define one or more [services](#service).

Essentially, a project is organized into modules at the granularity of its *build* steps. A module's build step may 
depend on one or more other modules, as specified in its `garden.yml`, in which case those modules will be built 
first, and their build output made available to the requiring module's build step.

#### Plugin
A [module's](#module) plugin type defines its behavior when it is built, deployed, run and tested. Currently,
`container` is the only stable plugin type, but plugin types for serverless functions and for build-only use cases
(such as NPM modules) are under development.

#### Project
The top-level unit of organization in Garden. A project consists of one or more [modules](#module), along with a 
project-level [`garden.yml` configuration file](../guides/configuration.md#project-configuration).

Garden CLI commands are run in the context of a project, and are aware of all its modules and services.

Currently, Garden projects assume that all their modules are rooted in subdirectories of the same Git repository, with
the project-level `garden.yml` located in the repository's top-level directory. In a future release, this mono-repo 
structure will be made optional.

#### Provider
An implementation of a [plugin type](#plugin) (e.g. `local-kubernetes` for the `container` plugin).

#### Service
The unit of deployment in Garden. Services are defined in their parent [module](#module)'s `garden.yml`, each 
exposing [one or more endpoints](../guides/configuration.md#services).

Services may depend on services defined in other modules, in which case those services will be deployed first, and 
their deployment output made available to the requiring service's deploy step.
