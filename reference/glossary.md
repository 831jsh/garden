# Glossary

## Environment

Represents the current configuration and status of any running services in the [project](glossary.md#project), which may be inspected and modified via the Garden CLI's `environment` command.

Several named environment configurations may be defined \(e.g. _dev_, _testing_, ...\) in the [project's `garden.yml`](../using-garden/configuration-files.md#project-configuration).

## Module

The basic unit of configuration in Garden. A module is defined by its [`garden.yml` configuration file](config.md), located in the module's top-level directory, which is a subdirectory of the [project](glossary.md#project) repository's top-level directory.

Each module has a plugin type, and may define one or more [services](glossary.md#service).

Essentially, a project is organized into modules at the granularity of its _build_ steps. A module's build step may depend on one or more other modules having already been built, as specified in its `garden.yml`, in which case those modules will be built first, and their build output made available to the requiring module's build step.

## Provider

A [module's](glossary.md#module) plugin type defines its behavior when it is built, deployed, run and tested. Currently, `container` \(for "standard" containerized services\) and `openfaas` \(for serverless functions\) are the only stable plugin types.

## Project

The top-level unit of organization in Garden. A project consists of one or more [modules](glossary.md#module), along with a project-level [`garden.yml` configuration file](config.md).

Garden CLI commands are run in the context of a project, and are aware of all its modules and services.

## Provider

An implementation of a plugin type \(e.g. `local-kubernetes` for the `container` plugin\).

## Service

The unit of deployment in Garden. Services are defined in their parent [module](glossary.md#module)'s `garden.yml`, each exposing [one or more ingress endpoints](config.md#container).

Services may depend on services defined in other modules, in which case those services will be deployed first, and their deployment output made available to the requiring service's deploy step.
